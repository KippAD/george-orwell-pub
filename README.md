# The George Orwell Pub

The George Orwell Pub website is a django based project for a fictional business developed for my fourth milestone project at Code Institute.

## Brief

The George Orwell Pub website serves as a point of information and booking system for a pub and restaurant based in Montpellier, France. Customers will be able to create an account, view upcoming events, and make bookings. Within their account they will be able to manage these bookings, as well as contact the site Admin with any queries that they might have. 

The objective of the project is to create an aesthetically pleasing design with functionality that allows users to access and interact with content easily, and that allows an Admin to intuitively control the data that the site works with..

## Agile Development

Using the User Stories above the site was developed using AGILE methodology. Components and features in the website were designed in order to meet the criteria of the user stories and each stage of development revolved around resolving each user story incrementally. 

This meant that each component added to the site could be prioritized by the importance of its corresponding user story.

## Design

### Design Objective
- The site is attractive and first time users want to return to it.
- Site actions are intuitive so that a user knows how to interact with content.
- The site is functional and errors and the user will be appropriately redirected when faced with errors
- Content is meaningfully organized by its priority

### Wireframes
The wireframes for the George Orwell Pub were made with Figma. Designs for multiple viewport sizes were created in order to create a design that would be responsive on various devices.

### Desktop

### Tablet

### Mobile

The final design holds true to the original concepts, but as development progressed certain aspects differed. This was usually due to design preference changing as time went on, and certain components looking better in the browser than they did in the wireframe.

## Features

### Existing

**Homepage:** The homepage is the first area that the user sees when entering the website. It includes a summary of the business and what it does, as well as clear navigation to other areas of the site and a carousel of upcoming events.


**Events Page:** The events page displays all upcoming events with the relevant information about them (Date, capacity, price). Each event is a collapsible element, revealing the event description when clicked on - this keeps the content more concise and allows the user to unravel information as they choose to. The user can also book an event by clicking on the Book now button and filling out the form. If an admin is logged in they are able to access full CRUD functionality for each event, as well as creating new events.

**Booking System:** The booking system allows users to reserve places for events of their choosing. There is full form validation preventing users from making double bookings and also from events becoming overbooked. 

**Contact Form:** The contact form allows users to send queries to the admin. This form is linked to Amazon Web Services SES, meaning that the userâ€™s messgae will appear in the gmail account of the site.

**Account Page:** The account page allows users to view, update, and delete their existing bookings. It will also display their account information in a separate tab.

**Admin Interface:** The admin interface displays all events, bookings, and users where the admin can perform CRUD functionality on each of their models.

**User Feedback Pages:** Unsuccessful bookings will redirect the user to a page explaining why their submission was rejected. Similarly a successful booking and contact form submission will display a success page.

**Accounts:** Users can register an account and login/logout. Once authenticated they are able to interact with the sites content.


## Future
Here are some future features that were outside of the project scope on the current iteration of development but could be included to improve the user experience and site in general.

- **Form Submission Email:** User receives an email when an account is created or when a booking is made.
- **Waiting List:** Users will have the option to join a waiting list for full events and receive an email if there is availability.
- **Prefilled Booking Form:** Booking form is prefilled with the event and can be replaced with a select form if the user chooses.
- **Repeating/Self Deleting Event:** Events can be set to repeating so that they automatically appear on the schedule each week, and events in the past self-delete.

- **Messaging In Browser:** User and admin can message within the website from the account and admin panels respectively.
- **Menu:** Admin has access to CRUD functionality for a menu.
- **Admin Interface for User:** Whilst the admin can see users in the admin panel, it redirects the admin to the default django admin dashboard, so CRUD functionality for the user within the website would provide a better experience for the site owner.
